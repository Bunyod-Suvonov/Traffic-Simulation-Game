# Overview
Thank you for visiting my Open-Source Project. This project is under development now, but you can still try out the p1.1 release. This is a simple game written using the Matlab programming language.
# Installation
In order to be able to play this game, clone those files in the current repo to your local directory. You must install the Matlab software using this link: https://www.mathworks.com/ in order to run the game. Open the main file named 'p1.m'. Other files are functions followed to the main file.
# Usage
There are different inputs in the beginning of the game and there are some rules you should care about:
- Enter less than 13 cars
- Enter integers for the width of the road
- Enter number between 0 and 1 for probability
- Enter any number for the duration of traffic lights' colors
Wait until the game ends itself.
# Bugs
- No bugs are found
